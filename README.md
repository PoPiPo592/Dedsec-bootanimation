# Dedsec-bootanimation
A DedSec boot animation I made a while ago, for Android, it's for Galaxy Gran Duos (I think), but can be ported to other phones
## How do I install it?
  _Work in progress since I did this years ago but downloading the branch for your screen resolution as .zip, renaming to bootanim.zip and copying to /system/media might be how I did, also obviously you need root access for that, might make a zip installer for Magisk or TWRP but only if actually needed, because i suck at coding_
  
DISCLAIMER: Watchdogs is a trademark of Ubisoft Entertainment, the only thing I did was edit the footage to fit the screen and some of the code part, videos I used were a part of the game, if needed i'll redo for higher/weird resolutions, also it's on you if your phone starts bootlooping, demands a platinum poker chip to start working again properly, or starts giving you riddles to solve with a cube and says that it'll give a cake to you, not my responsibility.
